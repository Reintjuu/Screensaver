# Screensaver
This is a TypeScript version of my originally created screensaver in AS3, especially made for my colleagues Ide and Lindy.

Be sure to have Visual Studio with the Web Developer Tools installed. 

# Demo
There's a demo available at http://teabagentertainment.com//typescriptscreensaver.html!
